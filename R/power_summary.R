#' Calculate sample size at a range of power levels.
#' 
#' Returns sample sizes needed to achieve a range of power levels for the hypothesis test
#' of marginal excursion effect (see Details) in the context of an MRT with binary outcomes
#' with small sample correction using F-distribution. See the vignette for
#' more details.
#' 
#' The sample size calculator is based on an asymptotic result with a small
#' sample correction. When the calculator finds out that a sample size less than
#' or equal to 10 is sufficient to attain the desired power, the calculator does
#' not output the exact sample size but produces an error message, because in
#' this situation the sample size result may not be as accurate. In general,
#' when the output sample size is small, one might reconsider the following: (1)
#' whether you are correctly or conservatively guessing the average of expected
#' availability, (2) whether the duration of study is too long, (3) whether the
#' treatment effect is overestimated, and (4) whether the power is set too low.
#'
#' @param avail_pattern A vector of length T that is the average availability at
#'   each time point
#' @param f_t           Defines marginal excursion effect MEE(t) under
#'   alternative together with beta. Assumed to be matrix of size T*p.
#' @param g_t           Defines success probability null curve together with
#'   alpha. Assumed to be matrix of size T*q.
#' @param beta          Length p vector that defines marginal excursion effect
#'   MEE(t) under alternative together with f_t.
#' @param alpha         Length q vector that defines success probability null
#'   curve together with g_t.
#' @param p_t           Length T vector of Randomization probabilities at each
#'   time point.
#' @param gamma         Desired Type I error
#' @param power_levels  Vector of powers to find sample size for.
#'
#' @return              Dataframe containing needed sample size to achieve
#'   user-specified power values.
